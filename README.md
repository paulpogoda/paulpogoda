Hi there, I’m Pavel "Pogoda" Bannikov (OR @paulpogoda OR just Pogoda). 
OSINT-investigator, fact-checker, trainer. Born in Kazakhstan, live around the world. But, you know, Almaty is the best city in this mad world.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the Central Asia region, but Eastern Europe or the Caucasus are OK too.
Learning Python, teaching journalists, fact-checkers, and OSINTers. Love to create something useful.

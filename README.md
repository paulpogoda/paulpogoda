## Hi there, I’m Pavel "Pogoda" Bannikov (OR @paulpogoda OR just Pogoda). 

OSINT investigator, fact-checker, profiler, and trainer. Born in Kazakhstan, live around the world. (But, you know, Almaty is the best city in this mad world.)
I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the Central Asia region, but Eastern Europe or the Caucasus are OK too.


Learning Python and Go, teaching journalists, fact-checkers, and OSINTers. Love to create something useful. 

**Join to the [OSINT-for-countries-V2.0 Project](https://github.com/paulpogoda/OSINT-for-countries-V2.0). Let's create useful and structured tutorial for country-specific OSINT together.**

- **Feel free to write me and [ask for a training proposal in Russian or English on my LinkedIn Service Page](https://www.linkedin.com/services/page/62913232ba4bb59a24/). Get a pro bono consultation if you and your team are based in Central Asia or the Caucasus.**

- **[Some free or very inexpensive educational OSINT content on my team's Patreon | In Russian](https://www.patreon.com/c/provereno).**
